# Lamprey-Detection-Using-CNN
Sea lampreys have become a major pest in the North American Great Lakes. They are considered as an invasive species that prey on many species of commercial value such as lake trouts, fishes and perches. To tackle this problem, we introduce LampNet, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classifier to detect lampreys. Our evaluations show that LampNet can identify and detect lampreys with an F1-score of 0.97 and an overall ROC-AUC score of 0.995. This framework could be extended to replace the human operating the fish elevator to prevent the lamprey from entering the water bodies.
